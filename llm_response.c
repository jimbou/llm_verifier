Certainly, I can help you structure the `is_prime` function along with a main function designed to be analyzed by KLEE, a symbolic execution tool. KLEE works by taking specially prepared code, executing it symbolically, and using constraints derived from the code paths to determine truths about the program, such as potential bugs or in this case, to verify the correctness of the prime checking function.

### Prime Function
In the `is_prime` function, a prime number is only divisible by 1 and itself, so we need to check divisibility from 2 up to the square root of `n` (since any factor larger than the square root would have a corresponding factor smaller than the square root).

### KLEE Main Function
For the main function, we'll create a symbolic variable (let's call it `a`). KLEE will treat this variable as symbolic, meaning KLEE will consider all possible values that `a` can take on that satisfy the constraints we impose. We'll then add constraints (using `klee_assume`) to ensure `a` is a positive number, as prime checking only makes sense for positive integers. Finally, we'll assert our expectations (using `klee_assert`) about the output of `is_prime` for specific values of `a` we know are prime or not.

Here's how your code could look:

```c
//start_function pls keep this comment in your response

int is_prime(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) return 0; // 0 and 1 are not prime numbers
    if (n <= 3) return 1; // 2 and 3 are prime numbers
    
    // This is checked so that we can skip middle five numbers in below loop
    if (n % 2 == 0 || n % 3 == 0) return 0;
    
    for (int i = 5; i * i <= n; i += 6) {
        if (n % i == 0 || n % (i + 2) == 0)
            return 0;
    }
    return 1;
}

//end_function pls keep this comment in your response

//start_main pls keep this comment in your response

#include <klee/klee.h>

int main() {
    int a;
    klee_make_symbolic(&a, sizeof(a), "a"); // klee symbolics creation

    klee_assume(a > 0); // necessary klee assumes, prime numbers are positive

    int result = is_prime(a); // call the function with the symbolic parameter

    // necessary klee asserts
    // Example assertions for known primes and non-primes for validation
    if (a == 2 || a == 3 || a == 5 || a == 7)
        klee_assert(result == 1); // Assert that the function recognizes known primes
    else if (a == 1 || a == 4 || a == 6 || a == 8 || a == 9)
        klee_assert(result == 0); // Assert that the function recognizes known non-primes

    return 0;
}

//end_main pls keep this comment in your response
```

In this setup, KLEE will explore various paths through the `is_prime` function, using both the assumptions and the assertions to guide and check its analysis. Remember, the effectiveness of this analysis greatly depends on the range of values KLEE considers for `a`, which is influenced by the constraints (`klee_assume`) you impose and the computational resources available for KLEE to use.
